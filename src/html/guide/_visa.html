          For most visitors to Mexico, a tourist visa, also known as a Visitor's Permit (FMM), is required and can be
          obtained upon arrival by land, air, or sea. This permit allows for stays of up to 180 days and is typically
          included in the cost of airline tickets or can be obtained at border checkpoints.

        <p class="text">
          Nationals of certain countries may require a visa in advance, so it's essential to check the specific
          requirements based on your nationality before traveling.

          Additionally, travelers should ensure their passports are valid for at least six months beyond their intended
          stay and have a return or onward ticket.
