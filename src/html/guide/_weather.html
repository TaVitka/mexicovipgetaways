          Discover Mexico's diverse climate, ranging from tropical in the south to desert and temperate in the central
          and northern regions. Generally, Mexico experiences two main seasons: a dry season from November to May and a
          rainy season from June to October, with temperatures varying depending on altitude and proximity to the coast.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          For optimal travel experiences, consider visiting coastal areas during the dry season for sunny beach days,
          while inland regions may offer more pleasant temperatures for exploration during the cooler months.
